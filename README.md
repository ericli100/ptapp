## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- DevContainer and Docker. This project uses [DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to set up the development environment, therefore, Docker is required.
- IDE with devContainer support. Initially, the project was created with Visual Studio Code

### Running the project

- Open the project in VSCode.
- VS Code should prompt: "Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container ". Follow the prompt to reopen the project in Container.
- If you missed the prompt, "Dev Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container"

Once you are in the container, run `npm install`, then `npm dev`
